## Description
I created this portfolio for myself to keep track of and catalogue my work through bootcamp so I have a source to give future employers so they know what I'm capable of.

## Usage

My portfolio contains a photo of myself, as well as a very brief description of myself. I included embedded screenshots of the two deployed applications I've worked on so far for bootcamp. There are also links to my facebook and instagram accounts, and my email address. The links at the top of the page will help navigate to each section.
